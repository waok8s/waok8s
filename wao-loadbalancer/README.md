## Overview

WAO Load Balancer is a custom kube-proxy that uses WAO to achieve energy-aware load balancing. Calculating the weight of each node based on the power consumption model, then updating the weight of the node in the kube-proxy implementation.

The following mode of kube-proxy is supported:
- nftables
- ipvs (deprecated)

## Getting Started

### Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have [wao-core](https://github.com/waok8s/wao-core) and [wao-metrics-adapter](https://github.com/waok8s/wao-metrics-adapter) set up.


1. Ensure kube-proxy is running in nftables mode.
2. Replace the container image of kube-proxy with our custom image.

### Deploy Services

TBD

### Check Current Weights

## Configuration

## Development

> [!WARNING]
> Do not edit the files in `cmd` and `pkg`, as they are generated by the build scripts.
> Instead, modify the files in `_src` and follow the build steps.

- Each kube-proxy mode has its own implementation, and we modify them to use WAO.
- The modified files are located in `_src` directory.
  - If you want to change the implementation, modify the files in `_src` and follow the build steps.
- Build scripts are provided in `hack` directory.
  - `build-01-copy-k8s-code.sh` copies the related files to `cmd` and `pkg` directories. 
  - `build-02-apply-patches.sh` overwrites the original files with the modified files in `_src`.
- After the preparation, you can just run `make build` to build the kube-proxy.

### Components

- See `_src/README.md` for details.

## Changelog

Versioning: we use the same major.minor as Kubernetes, and the patch is our own.

- 2025-xx-yy `v1.xx.0`
  - First release.
  - Support `nftables` `ipvs` mode.
